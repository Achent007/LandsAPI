+ ADDED Ability to use normal players commands for admin actions. Like deleting a land or trusting players.
Permissions: https://github.com/Angeschossen/Lands/wiki/Permissions#administrator-command-permissions

+ ADDED Option to prevent /Lands wild teleporting to WorldGuard regions
By default this is disabled. You'll need to enable it in config under manager integration settings for WorldGuard

+ ADDED Depth search for /Lands wild on startup
While this process might be resource intensive it will reduce resource usage a lot after server start. Also it runs fully asynchronus.
This is only done on startup, so you dont need to worry about any issues after server startup.

+ ADDED Option to allow color codes in land names: titles.color-name

+ ADDED Mail box to your land menu. There you can keep track of all events.
