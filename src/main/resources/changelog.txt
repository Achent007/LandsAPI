+ You can now create areas inside your land which sizes are actually defined by blocks
instead of chunks. They are three-dimensional.

This setting may be relevant to you:
    # Area Settings
    # Areas are created inside a land by blocks, not chunks.
    area:
      # Set the minimum size of a area (in blocks).
      # With this setting you can force your players to organize their areas.
      min-size: 60


+ ADDED /Lands spawn will not teleport to the initial claimed chunk if no spawn is set.
